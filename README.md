OwlCoin
=======

OwlCoin is an ENGI 120 team at Rice University. We aim to create a low-cost cryptocurrency mining device for distribution to high schools and colleges around the country to expose more people to this world-altering technology.

This software enables the user to connect to a cryptocurrency network and mine OwlCoin. It facilitates this by using multiple methods of user interaction:

* a screen that indicates the balance of cryptocurrency in the user's wallet, as well as any other pertinent messages
* a red LED that is used to indicate errors
* a green LED to indicate that the device is currently running, to ensure safe shutdown


In order to use this repository, it is necessary to have access to the OwlCoin mining network. We cannot allow this, as it would conflict with the goals of our device.

Here are a few pictures of OwlCoin in action:
